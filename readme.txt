Global topics
 - Syntax highlight
 - Suggestions
 - Auto-import external functions and variables
 - Show compilation errors
 - Go to definitions
 - Prettier
 - Collapse parts of the code
 - View files and folders

Problems
 - I don't know how to parse html/css + other code like C, GLSL, C++ (god forbid)
 - I need to figure out how to add typpes from npm packages (@types/react, etc). Consider using typeRoots option in compiler options
 - Do I need Desktop App (Electron/Tauri) or I can fit this into a PWA
    - Main concert for this is file system access. For PWA you need permission each time you launch app

Typescript API responsibilities
 - Tokenizer
 - Show errors
 - Show suggestions (complete, import, etc)
 - Go to definition (getDefinitionAtPosition)

Prettier 
 - Just fucking format code (read config file in a project .prettier or use defaults)

Backlog
   - Autoscroll when going down or up (postponed)
   - Move typescript access to service worker for snappy UI
   - Try to preserve cursor position after formatting. VS Code is not doing a perfect job, but quite a good job at this (use formatWithCursor from prettier)
   - Add 'desired' column position, so that when you move vertically, your cursor stays on the same col if posible
   - Multiple cursors
   - Cache d.ts and js files (make it working as PWA offline using another service worker)
   - Support unit tests? Like wallaby.js but minimal would be super usefull

Vim 
 Vim Progress
   ‚úî HJKL movement
   ‚úî two modes: normal and insert. Switch between them via i and Esc
   ‚úî w b justs words back and forth
   ‚úî O and o to add new lines and switch to insert mode (yet buggy)


 Vim Backlog
   - rd and rl rs re to replace word, like, end of line, start of line
   - when jumping words consider punctuation, not just space and \n
   - Have you own console, canvas, dom inside IFrame, whatever
   - Format the code when exiting insert mode? 

Timeline
 Week 47
  21.11.2024
    - Show lines of text
    - Move around via HJKL
    - Two modes: normal and insert
    - Add/remove chars 
    - Jump words back and forth

  22.11.2024
   - Tokenize source code and show source code tokenized

   - typescript module supports completion list
   - getDefinitionAtPosition

  23.11.2024
   ‚úî Fix cursor navigation bug
   ‚úî Cleanup lang service (find relation between lang service and program)
   ‚úî Extract model updates on events, reduce draw time to 0.2-2ms (still can be reduced)
   ‚úî Create a template file (with webpack build support) for service worker

  24.11.2024
   ‚úî Integrate prettier for TS code. KeyS to format code
   ‚úî KeyR to run code via simple eval function
   ‚úî O and o to insert a new line above and below (buggy)
   ‚úî d to remove current line

 
 Week 48 
  Goals 
   - Further integration with TS compiler, namely
     - Go to definition
     - Auto-suggestions
     - Go throught errors
     - Auto-import
   - Suport projects with multiple files. Sync code with file system

  25.11.2024 
   ‚úî Add ability to compile via ESNext
   êÑÇ Checking if I need to extract lang service into ServiceWorker
   - Working on resolving ts errors
  
  26.11.2024
   ‚úî Apply code fix for errors

  29.11.2024
    Plan for the day
      - Open/save file (show file path at the bottom)
      - Start implementing web worker for lang service 
   ‚úî Load code from the file
   ‚úî Fix issue with prettier. Use formatWithCursor to preserve cursor
   ‚úî Save code to the file 
   - Found https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/main/build/importTypescript.ts 
     - this generates typescript script for worker

  01.12.2024
   ‚úî Integrate web worker with diagnostic messages
